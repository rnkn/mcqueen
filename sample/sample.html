        <p class="note">A typical title page may look like this. For the Academy Nicholl Fellowships competition, you should eliminate all instances of your name, address, phone number and email address from the title page and all other pages of the screenplay. Only the title of the screenplay is needed. It is also permissible to include a U.S. Copyright Office or WGA registration number on the title page (though registration is not a requirement).</p>
        <p class="note">This format guide was originally written by Greg Beal in 1996 and has been revised several times by him since then, most recently in February, 2014.</p>

                <p class="note">A FEW ADDITIONAL NOTES:<br>  <br>How closely should the format presented on the above pages be followed?<br>  <br>Close enough so that your script at least resembles these pages. That said, there is no absolute standard format within the U.S. film industry. The format used by professional screenwriters can vary considerably from writer to writer - but overall the format used by one professional writer generally resembles that used by another professional writer. Nuances may vary -- margins slightly different, a dash here or there, parentheticals used this way or that or not at all -- but overall, professional screenplays fit within or near these guidelines.<br>Clarity is the goal. If your script's format can be easily read by anyone working in the film industry, then it falls within acceptable standards.<br>  <br>Do realize that "shooting scripts," the form in which scripts are most often available online, in books and at libraries, are not the form in which most professional writers submit their scripts. Submission scripts, sales scripts, first draft scripts -- all usually share certain characteristics: no scene numbers, few designated camera shots and sequences generally written in master scenes.<br>  <br>If you're confused about which nuances are acceptable and which would push your script into an "out-of-format" category, you would do well to follow these guidelines and eliminate those questionable nuances.</p>
