        <p>Here is an example of using a snippet of a screenplay within other content flow.</p>
        <section class="screenplay">
            <div class="dialog">
                <div class="character">JOE</div>
                <div class="lines">Are we in time?</div>

            <div class="dialog">
                <div class="character">APRIL</div>
                <div class="lines">How could they start without us? We're the main attraction.</div>
            </div>
            <p class="action">Joe catches his breath as he leans against the podium at the front of the room.</p>
            <div class="dialog dual left">
                <div class="character">JOE</div>
                <div class="paren">(looking about the room)</div>

                <div class="character">APRIL</div>
                <div class="lines">Don't be an idiot. You know we've been invited to Austin to discuss script format.</div>

                <div class="character">JOE</div>
                <div class="lines">But why is the room empty?</div>
            </div>
            <p class="action">April and Joe look out across the room - rows of empty chairs and nary a person in sight.</p>
            <div class="dialog">
                <div class="character">APRIL</div>
                <div class="lines">Okay, okay. Don't panic.</div>
            </div>
            <p class="action">She takes three deep breaths. Then April looks at her watch and smiles.</p>
